Hi there. We are TheReviewIndex.com - here to help you discover the right gadgets for your very individual needs.

As you know, the internet is a source of humongous amounts of unstructured information, in the form of blogs, videos, user and expert reviews, etc, for all sorts of gadgets. It is almost impossible for anyone to make sense of all this disparate (sometimes spammy) data, with contradictory opinions, and thereafter make an ideal, or at least optimal, purchase decision.

And so, we created [The Review Index](https://thereviewindex.com) - a discovery and research engine, which aims to simplify the process of researching products online. We crawl various information sources on the web and aggregate opinions for products. Once we have brought all reviews together, we detect fine-grained topics of discussion and implicit sentiment in review sentences, after blacklisting unnatural content. This information is churned and presented as an unbiased, feature-wise summary scorecard of the aggregate opinion, along with the relevant pros and cons. Not just that, you can also use the search engine to discover products based on your specific feature requirements. Lastly, the engine compares the prices for products across all the online stores, to conclude which one has the most cost-effective offering.

We launched a public beta recently in a few categories. This is just the beginning of our journey. We are working on adding new categories (in electronics, home appliances, etc.) and iterating over the website and algorithms while we are at it. 

There is a lot of data waiting to be churned and presented - stay tuned!
